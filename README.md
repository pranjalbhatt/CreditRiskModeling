# Credit Risk Management and Simulation

This project is done was undertaken for completion of a graduate course (MIE1622) at University of Toronto. Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for various credit instruments is modeled based on their migration probabilities. Monte Carlo Simulation for a factor model (structural model) is generated for 100,000 out sample (true) scenarios and it's performance to another generated in-sample distribution is compared. Model error, Sample error and it's effects on falsly assuming a normal distribution is observed.
